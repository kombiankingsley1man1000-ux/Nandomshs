               <h2>About Nandom Senior High School Admissions</h2>
              <p>New students are admitted every September through a computerized system managed by the Ghana Education Service.
               Admission is based on the Basic Education Certificate Examination (B.E.C.E) results, held annually for junior high school students at various centers nationwide.
               Entry forms for the B.E.C.E examination are obtained from the West African Examination Council (W.A.E.C) through junior high school headteachers.
               After the computerized selection process, the Ghana Education Service releases the admission list to the school, which is then posted on the school's notice board.
               Foreign nationals can apply for admission through a written entrance examination organized by the school.
               Students from other senior high schools or fresh senior high school starters can contact the school's administration directly using the contact information provided.
               Upon admission, students receive the school's official prospectus, which outlines requirements and expectations.</p>
